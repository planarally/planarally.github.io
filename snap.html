                        <p>Our target persona was youth (13-19 year olds) affected by incarceration; either themselves, or a loved one. Because of the negative stigma around incarceration, many feel shame and fear about speaking out about their traumatic experiences around mass incarceration. This fear makes it difficult to find a community that sees them  or their loved one as a person rather than a problem, and the shame makes it difficult to express themselves.</p><br>
                        <p>As someone who personally has experience with multiple family members having experienced incarceration, this topic hit close to home. In the Snap Academies we were asked to rank topics for our final project based on our interest in them; this was my first choice.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Something that affected me deeply as a young person, that POPS the club's mission completely aligned with, was an arts retreat I went on in high school. During this retreat I wrote a poem about my exprience with a loved one having been incarcerated, and read it aloud. It was an extremely vulnerable and yet liberating feeling, and even though I was afraid to talk about it, the poem also affected other students and teachers. After that moment of sharing, I no longer felt shame around my loved ones' situation.</p>

                        <p>This was my first time working on a UX project on a team, and it was amazing to have that learning experience at snapchat. Each team was comprised of designers, engineers, and storytellers to deliver a concept for a Snapchat feature at the end of a two week sprint. I was one of two designers on this project, and our main role was creating the visual design of the app. However, we began with subject matter expert interviews, which the entire team participated in, as well as brainstorming sessions to come up with the project concept, our persona, and our final presentation that would be given in front of a crowd of 100+ people.

                        <p>A few days before our final presentation, we received new feedback from one of our mentors at Snap that was, at the time, hard to hear. "It's not Snap," was the jist of it, and he was correct. Our color pallete which was originally purples and blacks was nowhere near the iconic blue, white, and yellow of Snap. So we changed the color schemes and fonts to match Snapchat's branding, however, that was not the only issue: the correct colors highlighted the fact that the layout and interaction design was not emphasizing the photo-first concept that Snapchat made popular. Instead, we had created a blogging platform more akin to Facebook or Tumblr within Snapchat. We had been too insular in our design process, and should have sought out more feedback earlier to get us out of our design space that was fundamentally wrong. Thankfully, we still had time to overhaul the visual and interaction design while still maintaining the core concept of personal expression in our Snap Mini.</p>

                            <p>The team came together in such a tremendous way even with the daunting task of redesigning only a few days before the presentation. When other groups were practicing their pitch, we were reworking our prototype. However, the final product was leagues better and indeed, more inline with Snap's design principles. We were extremely proud and excited to pitch our concept at the presentation.</p>

                            <p>My summer with Snap Academies was completely invaluable as an introduction to design in tech, and its where I learned to love working on a team. Shortly after my summer at Snap I began my Bachelor's program at Santa Monica College in their interaction design program, which would only hone my skills further. Overall, a two week sprint to create a pitch for a huge company was an amazing learning experience, especially with the adversity our team faced.</p>
