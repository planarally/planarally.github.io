CicLAvia has a huge impacts on the neighborhoods it holds events in, and on the people who attend, and our task was to capture and share that impact, and communicate how important community events like CicLAvia are to potential attendees as well as public and private sponsors.</p>

                            <p>Most people think CicLAvia is just a bike ride. They don’t know about CicLAvia’s larger intention, which is to redefine the relationship between Los Angeles, its citizens and visitors, and transportation as a whole. They also don’t know what a powerful impact these events have on participants and the community.</p><br>

We saw opportunities in all three areas for developing a storytelling method that could be implemented by CicLAvia. </p><br>

                        <p>We conducted 10 interviews with stakeholders and subject matter experts to gain insights about their perspectives and experiences with CicLAvia. We were looking to uncover information that could inform and enhance the storytelling and community engagement aspects of CicLAvia events. These ranged from board members, to high level employees, to various individuals who had partnered with CicLAvia. The insights we gained about the event and its impact were invaluable, and we had tons of directions we might have pursued. This was by far the most extensive interview process I had conducted due to the amount of people and the brief window of time we had to complete them. It required a lot of planning and scheduling, and overall, it was extremely successful.</p><br><br>

                        <p>Our first CicLAvia event was one of their more recent concepts: instead of their usual, several-miles-long route, it was only a short mile and a half on Lankershim Blvd. We observed all the exciting activity, talked to participants and business owners to get a feel for the event, and even tried shooting some man on the street video content to see how receptive the participants would be! Since it was all team members’ first time at a CicLAvia event, we conducted observational research during the event as well as short conversations with attendees, focusing on identifying factors that attract people and made them stop along the route.

                            <p>Our next event was an exciting one: the Heart of LA, spanning all through Downtown LA, from Chinatown to Little Tokyo, Mariachi Plaza to South Park. The variety of faces and spaces would be hard to top, so we took full advantage by both setting up a short activity in the morning and then exploring the hub and surveying participants and businesses in the afternoon. We had a signboard inviting attendees to share their experiences and complete a survey. The survey was designed to gain insights from event-goers to understand what attracted them to the event, their preferred communication channels and social media platforms, and the activities they engaged in at the event.</p>

                        <p>Also at the Heart of LA event, we tried a concept that I had brainstormed: we printed a map of the downtown area and highlighted the CicLAvia route, and asked attendees to write down a favorite memory they had of downtown LA and to pin their memory to a map. Folks went further than just a memory and added their favorite places to eat, marked where they lived, and more! We also offered water, snacks, and shade on a hot day! People loved this activity; the colorful map caught attentions quickly, and many passerbys would stop to read what others had posted on the board. Some even took photos! We saw this as a really interesting way to gather quick impressions from attendees.</p>

                            <p>Outreach shifts are an integral part to the life cycle of a CicLAvia event. They flyer homes, businesses, and other institutions along their routes multiple times before an event to inform the community of the street closures. We took the opportunity to observe the outreach process and talk to members of their team to see how storytelling could either contribute to or sprout from this process. However, we realized that the timing of our project was not ideal for designing something for the outreach process, so even though this experience was valuable, we ultimately could not create something for them to deploy.</p>

                        <p>We reprised our Memory Map activity at the South LA event with a few changes. We stayed for the entire duration of the event to get more responses, printed an even bigger map so that multiple people could pin things to it at once, and instead of giving out disposable water bottles, created a water-fill up station to entice participants. We had a gopro filming a timelapse of the event and were able to talk with tons of people about their LA and CicLAvia stories! We were able to create this activity at very low cost due to resources available to us at our school. The highest cost item would be printing the map itself, which depending on quality could be $100+ dollars. However there is potential for reuse of the map itself as well as pushpins, etc.</p>

                        <p>We were so inspired by our subject matter expert interviews when researching this project, and amazed at the stories we heard. We know the public would be too! So we rented some film equipment and send out some emails with the intention of capturing those stories for CicLAvia. We filmed for two days at the CicLAvia offices, and captured some stories at CicLAvia: South LA as well. We used a camera, two microphones, and three LED panels to create our mini-set inside the CicLAvia offices. We are not professional filmmakers, but the equipment does the job for us: the interviews look and sound amazing! At the CicLAvia event itself, we used just a cellphone and a small microphone, and they look just as good!</p>

                        <p>This was one of our most extensively researched & physically active projects during the IXD program. Our team was incredibly harmonious and well-balanced which made the workload of ten interviews, three events, and one outreach day in 18 weeks go very smoothly. We were able to deliver high-quality interview videos for CicLaVia's immediate use, and created an executive summary on how they could deploy the Memory Map at future events. I felt that we were incredibly ambitious during this project for executing two different concepts that required different preperation and execution, and even though it was tiring, it's one of the projects I'm most proud of during my time at SMC.</p>
