                        <p>For our senior capstone in the IXD program, we were asked to make something that complimented all the work we had achieved in our studies. The prompt was wide open; we could do any kind of design that interested us, or fill a gap in our portfolio that we were interested in. I decided to really have fun with it and go all in on a dream project of mine: developing a video game.</p>

                            <p>As a designer, artist, and writer, I always knew I wanted to work in the landscape of videogames. I love how games can be used to create unique narrative experiences; how they transport us to new worlds and new ways of thinking, and specifically, I am fascinated by the idea of game mechanics themselves telling the story. After all, what sets video games apart from other artistic mediums is the interaction.</p><br>

                            <p>The world of solo game development is one where I knew I’d be allowed to really flex my skills, and pick up a few more along the way. At the beginning of 2024, I was a complete novice to game development. UI, UX, and flat illustration were not the problem — it was the project management angle, the animation, and learning developer tools like Unity and C# that would be the challenges. From scratch, I taught myself (with a little help from my friends) to build and publish games, and was able to create a beautiful demo for my interactive narrative...</p><br>

                        <p>Because of the brief amount of time allotted for this project (only sixteen weeks, which is tight even for the experienced developer), instead of trying to design new gameplay mechanics, I relied on many of my favorite mechanics to make up the design pillars of Ventura Girls. I was inspired by this tweet from Josh Sawyer, a senior developer at Obsidian who has made many of my favorite games.
                        While I believe it is possible to come up with new mechanics that may interest and delight people, almost all games are riffing on the mechanics and stylings of others. It's all about making them feel uniquely put together to design a new experience for players.

                        <p>One of the main inspirations for Ventura Girls comes in the form of the visual novel, like Ace Attorney, where the main draw is learning about characters and the world and being led through a mystery. Narratives in games are only getting stronger, with examples such as the Yakuza series and Disco Elysium. As a writer, I wanted the story of my game to be the main draw.

                        <p>Narrative games can, however, be boring to the player, if they don't feel like they are given a choice in the outcomes. I want the players of my game to feel like the actions they take directly effect the outcome; not so much in a sense of "winning" or "losing," but rather, feeling like they are living another life. Games like Dragon Age: Origins or the more recent Pentiment are my main inspiration for this kind of branching narrative.

                        <p>Having clocked likely thousands of hours in games like Skyrim and Assassins Creed, it's fair to say that exploring an interesting and detailed world is my favorite element in gaming. Specifically with Asassins Creed, being able to explore a historical space is incredible because it also allows the player to learn about and live through history, bringing a little edu-tainment into the mix.

                        <p>While more of a niche these days, there was a time when rhythm games ruled the world, with Dance Dance Revolution and Guitar Hero. I love rhythm games, but I think there was a missed opportunity in them where they didn't contribute to a strong narrative. In Ventura Girls, the main characters are members of a band, so I wanted to include this mechanic as a different way to advance the story, as well as get some cool music for the player to enjoy!

                        <p>Ventura Girls would be more than just a game; it would be a love letter to a bygone era that shaped my artistic journey from a young age. It all began when I discovered The Who at the age of thirteen, sparking a passion for classic rock and the counterculture movements of the 60s. I would explore this in the world of film as well, with camp classics like Beyond the Valley of the Dolls inspiring Ventura Girls with irreverent kitsch and commentary on the absurdity of the era. But it wasn't just the entertainment industry that captivated me; learning about figures like Hunter S. Thompson who epitomized the era’s spirit of disillusionment supercharged my interest in politics and history. Furthermore, as a woman with an interest in games, I thought making a women-centered story set in this time period of great civil change could be a welcome addition to the gaming scene.

                            <p>I had never taken on a solo project quite at this scale, so I knew that project management tools would be important to making sure I could deliver something by the end of the sixteen weeks. Notion was a valuable ally in this, and I made a master design doc where I could store all my thoughts, notes, task lists and deadlines for the game. I made a rough timeline for myself that granted ample time for me to make assets (which I knew would take the longest) and develop in Unity. I also had a weekly blog section where I could track my progress and easily communicate it to others.</p>

                        <p>As with everything, sketches were the starting point of my visual development for Ventura Girls. Oftentimes this would look like me throwing on a movie that reflected the period and drawing what I saw on the screen. Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, Valley of the Dolls, Dream Girls, Blow-Up, 2001: A Space Oddysey, Star Trek, and Le Samourai served as great sources of visual inspiration.</p>

                            <p>I wanted to make the game in a pixellated style because I had never done that kind of artwork before and thought it would be a fun artistic exploration. I also was interested in creating a sense of nostalgic visual dissonance by making a game set in the 60's be stylized with pixels; the visuals of "older" games mixed with an "older" time period. I worked primarily in photoshop, which was really friendly to pixel art creation and resizing. Perhaps the game wouldn't be "true" 32-bit pixels because of the resizing, but the vibes are still there. Using this method, I created all the UI elements and background images, and multiple versions of the character models representing their different moods, once again inspired by visual novels like Ace Attorney.

                        <p>Since music plays such an integral role in Ventura Girls, I wanted something that would stand out. I worked with a local band here in Los Angeles, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pachoink_/">Pachoink</a> to develop the sound, both of the Ventura Girls themselves and the background music in the world. It was both really fun to work with them, and an interesting challenge to convey the ideas of the game to them while still in the development stage. The music they made is awesome, drawing inspiration from late-era Kinks and Hannah-Barbera classics.</p>

                        <p>The main exercise with this project was seeing if I could learn a new tool quickly. I have some background in programming, mostly for web and in classes using python and processing, but C# would be a new challenge. It took some time and a lot of youtube videos, but I was able to figure out the basics of unity to create a rhythm demo. I also made use of the unity plugin Rhythm Timeline, which made the process a lot simplier, but still having to learn the little details and where exactly to manage all the assets was a challenge! However, I feel more and more comfortable the more time I spend in Unity, and am excited to continue making the game on this platform.</p>

                                    <p>Narrowing down all the work I had into a 6-minute presentation was a great challenge. I decided to focus primarily on making it into a pitch, drawing inspiration from all those E3 pressers I've watched over the years. Knowing that the guests we would have critiquing our presentations were all in game development themselves, I felt comfortable using higher-level language to describe the game, and it was received very well!

                                    <p>The final piece of the project was working to develop a physical space to present my game. This was extremely fun, and I got to dabble in art direction by making a whole VIBE zone for my game. I painted cardboard walls with a funky 60's pattern, invested in a fuzzy rug and a lava lamp, and brought a selection of my vinyl and books from home (all the pre-1971 releases) to create a cohesive, inviting space where I could showcase my work, talk to folks about my process, and have people play the rhythm demo. It was a tiring night and maybe I shouldn't have worn the platform shoes, but I had a great time, and it was also an awesome opportunity for playtesting. Even people who weren't experienced gamers wanted to give it a try!</p>

                        <p>It was amazing to get a chance like this to explore a new world of design that I had always loved, but never had first hand experience with. It was a great excercise in learning a new program and method of design, and I'm really pleased with the result. I definitely ran into time management issues along the way, as I think many game developers do: after learning that one piece of background art could take me up to 12 hours to complete, I realized I needed to change scope from having the first few levels playable at the end of 16 weeks, to instead having a really tight rhythm demo. I'm excited to continue working on this project and see it to completion, and intend to submit it to trade shows like Indiecade. Having had the grad show experience I feel confident in being able to showcase my work in a physical space and talking to people about the process! They say the best way to learn how to do something is by doing it, and I definitely felt like I dove into this project headfirst, and was grateful to have the space and opportunity to do so as my senior project.</p>
