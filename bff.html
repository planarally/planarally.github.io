Being a certified B-corporation, one of our major constraints was making sure the item was as eco-friendly as possible both through the materials used and the manufacturing process. We were also to create a digital companion to our item that would further enhance its use, drive item engagement, and promote whatever brand the item could be sold to. Our product to redesign: the luggage tag.</p>

                            <p>The luggage tag has had the same design for hundreds of years, so how do we update it? Furthermore, how can we create additional use cases so that it doesn’t just sit in the closet most of the time?</p><br>

                            <p>If an item is unique and well made, consumers will hold onto it for longer, and potentially share it with family/turn it into an heirloom. Instead of a luggage tag, we could create a different kind of luggage ID system that potentially has other use cases as well.</p><br>

                        <p>Our initial product ideation sketches were broad as we experimented with form factor, branding choices, and a variety of use cases. We quickly shied away from the traditional luggage tag, opting for more creative solutions that had potential for additional functionality beyond luggage identification. Our mentor Jamila was drawn to similar items that she felt promoted circularity and re-use: the “bracelet” design was something she was interested in as an item that could be worn “off luggage.” This concept, “off luggage,” was what primarily inspired our final idea. </p>

                        <p>We went through many of the sample items and swatches at the Macher offices, and it was during one of these sessions we began to nail down final material ideas. One of the main problems with luggage tags in their current form is the clear window made of non-recyclable plastic, so we were immediately drawn to a recycled PET mesh as a replacement. A material we all were intrigued by was upcycled billboards. We were inspired by competing products and the idea that we would be saving something that was typically sent right to the landfill. The lightness and flexibility of the product while still being very durable was also highly valued.

                            <p>We used the prototyping stage to further experiment with materials and form factors for the BFF. Though we were already leaning towards the billboard material, the exercise of making the BFF out of the washable paper and faux leather helped rule those options out. We were encouraged by our Product Design professor to try different shapes, but in the end we stuck to the traditional rectangle, not only because it fit common items most comfortably, but also because it would waste less material during the manufacturing process than an oblong or circular shape.</p>

                        <p>Our initial ideas for the digital companion ranged widely: geo-tagged AR experiences, bag-tracking tools, and social media platforms. What grounded us was aiming for the digital companion to not be a separate experience from the physical product, but rather, an enhancement. We rendered nearly twenty screens for our low-fidelity version to roughly encompass every feature we wanted the BFF album to have. Our goal was to develop an aesthetic that was reminiscent of a scrapbook while still feeling modern and easy to navigate.</p>

                            <p>Creating a good pitch is key to a successful project. For this collaboration, we had to present our idea in a concise manner to the MaCher staff as well as major stakeholders from their partner companies. We decided using well-researched personas and illustrating the use of a project through storyboarding would be the easiest way to show how to use the BFF. We kept our pitch to under ten minutes and rehearsed very well, and in the end, really impressed our audience!</p>

                        <p>Ultimately, the bag came in at about 7.5” wide and 4.25” tall, and it would expand to a width of about 1”, to fit a chunky phone case or wallet. The billboard is easy to work with and the pre-printed advertisements may offer the opportunity for interesting designs by collaging different colors or prints. If the intention is to print a custom design on the bag, the flip-side may be used as it’s typically solid white or black. During our research into costs we found that with an approximate order of 400,000 BFF strap sets, the manufacturing and shipping cost per product would only be around $1.50, even with mostly sustainable materials! Considering our original budget was $5.00, this impressed many of our stakeholders.</p>

Users’ data would be kept secured via a URL only accessible by tapping the NFC chip on the bag and creating a passcode for that bag’s album. Users would be able to collect stamps and rewards, and take photos to share to the album, using unique stickers to share across social media. Any content a user shared on the album could be retroactively changed or deleted via the same secure URL and passcode created during setup.</p>

                        <p>It was amazing to have this hands-on experience in the product design world, and be able to tie it into my knowledge of digital design. I’m also grateful that I had such a cohesive team that communicated well and complemented each other’s skills and knowledge. I learned a lot about large-scale manufacturing, especially in the eco-friendly industry, which is great since it also aligns with my own principles. Our product was really well received by MaCher, who showed interest in further developing it, and even had it prototyped in their partner factory in China!</p>
